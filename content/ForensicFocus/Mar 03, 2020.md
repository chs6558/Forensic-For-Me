## 13 Cubed shared a memory forensics challenge

- What is CTF? Capture The Flag. 상대방의 Flag(깃발)을 찾는 방식 

  13 cubed에서 mini memory CTF를 개최한다.

  There are four memory forensics questions

  Each answer is the format of an MD5 hash

  memory forensic에 대해 CTF를 주최하니 참여해보고 추후에 자신이 맞게 했는지 확인할 수 있게 upload하여 줄테니 확인할 수 있도록 하는 대회 참여를 장려하는 기사이다 

## Petr Stuchlik discusses SMB endpoint fingerprinting

network forensic에 대한 정보로 예상된다. 

What is SMB protocol?

- network communication protocol for providing shared access to files, printer, and serial ports between node an a network.

this article focus on message that carry hints about the connected endpoint.

These hints can be used to infer knowledge about the client and server. 

**This process is called fingerprinting**

1. **Protocol negotiation**

   SMB1 NegotiateProtocolRequest carries information about the dialects that the client understands

   SMB2 NEGOTIATE request contains a list of client's dialects and SMB 3.x capabilities

   These bits are specific to client implementation and thus can be used as part of the client's fingerprint. 

   The same applies for the response as well. 

   Fields like server capabilites.
